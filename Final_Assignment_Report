For my final assignment, I chose to visualize some of my RDF triples using the SPARQL and ggplot2 packages in R.
I chose to make 5 visualizations that I felt would best represent the the work that I had done to reconcile the dataset.
Most of the data manipulation was carried out in the R Scripts that I have stored in this github repository:
https://github.com/jtornberg97/INLS-620-Final-Project

The SPARQL queries that I ran to retrieve the data for each visualization are listed below:

Normalized Average Home Runs Allowed Per Team 1960-2015

    PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
    PREFIX MLB: <http://localhost:3333/>
    PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
    SELECT ?TeamSeason ?TeamName ?HRA ?yearID
    WHERE {
      ?TeamSeason MLB:HomeRunsAllowed ?HRA .
      ?TeamSeason MLB:TeamName ?TeamName .
      ?TeamSeason MLB:Year ?yearID .
        FILTER (?yearID > 1960).
    }
 
Normalized Earned Run Average Per Team 1960-2015

  PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
  PREFIX MLB: <http://localhost:3333/>
  PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
  SELECT ?TeamSeason ?TeamName ?ERA ?yearID
  WHERE {
    ?TeamSeason MLB:EarnedRunAverage ?ERA .
    ?TeamSeason MLB:TeamName ?TeamName .
    ?TeamSeason MLB:Year ?yearID .
        FILTER (?yearID > 1960).
  }
  
Home Runs Per Team 1980 v.s. 2000 

  SELECT ?TeamName ?HR ?yearID
  WHERE {
    ?TeamSeason MLB:HomeRuns ?HR .
    ?TeamSeason MLB:TeamName ?TeamName .
    ?TeamSeason MLB:Year ?yearID .
        FILTER(?yearID = 1980)
  }
  
Total Home Runs Per Season 1900-2015

  SELECT ?TeamSeason ?HR ?yearID
  WHERE {
    ?TeamSeason MLB:HomeRuns ?HR .
    ?TeamSeason MLB:Year ?yearID .
        FILTER ((?yearID > 1900) && (?yearID < 2016))
  }
 
Chicago Cubs Home Runs Per Year 1980-2000
  SELECT ?TeamName ?HR ?yearID
  WHERE {
    ?TeamSeason MLB:HomeRuns ?HR .
    ?TeamSeason MLB:TeamName ?TeamName .
        FILTER (?TeamName = 'Chicago Cubs')
    ?TeamSeason MLB:Year ?yearID .
        FILTER (?yearID > 1989 && ?yearID < 2001) .
}
